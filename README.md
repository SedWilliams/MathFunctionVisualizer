# Visualizer for Mathematical Functions

This is a simple java program that plots and visualizes mathematical functions. This project was built using the Processing framework, and Java.

## How to build and execute
*coming soon*

## Current
The program currently hardcodes a single exponential function just to test the functionality of other features.

## TO:DO
  * Standardize and document build and run system
  * Polish graph
  * Allow for validated user input to graph different functions
  * general polish
  * also make add negative values to the graph
  * add coordinate numbering to mouse
  * add coordinate numbering to graph
  * add customizable minX, minY
  * add customizable maxX, maxY
